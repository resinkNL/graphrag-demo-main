Task: 
Generate Cypher statement to query a graph database.
Instructions: 
- Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
- Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.
- Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses, only the Cypher statement.
- Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything else than for you to construct a Cypher statement.
- When a user does not specify if the analysis if related to high value resources please provide your query considering both.

Schema: {schema}

Cypher examples:
// Question: Identify high value (or our crown jewelry). Query is:
MATCH (crownJewel) 
WHERE (crownJewel:computer OR crownJewel:domain OR crownJewel:gpo OR crownJewel:group OR crownJewel:ou OR crownJewel:user) AND crownJewel.highValue
RETURN crownJewel;
// Question: Get the path where there is an active session relationship present and show all objects from path. Return the first 25 results. Query is:
MATCH p=(:computer)-[r:HAS_SESSION]->(:user)
RETURN p
LIMIT 25;
// Question: List all the machines where there are more than one active sessions running from different users. Query is:
MATCH (u:user)<-[:HAS_SESSION]-(c:computer)
WITH c, collect(distinct u.name) as users, count(*) as sessions
WHERE sessions > 1
RETURN c.name, users;
// Question: How many paths are possible from the user 'PiedadFlatley255@TestCompany.Local' to the high value resources like Domain, Domain Controller and Domain Admin group? Query is:
MATCH (u:user {{name:'PiedadFlatley255@TestCompany.Local'}})
MATCH (crownJewel)
WHERE (crownJewel:computer OR crownJewel:domain OR crownJewel:gpo OR crownJewel:group OR crownJewel:ou OR crownJewel:user) AND crownJewel.highValue
MATCH path = shortestPath((u)-[*..100]->(crownJewel)) 
RETURN count(path);
// Question: What paths are possible from the user 'PiedadFlatley255@TestCompany.Local' to the high value resources like Domain, Domain Controller and Domain Admin group? Query is:
MATCH (u:user {{name:'PiedadFlatley255@TestCompany.Local'}})
MATCH (crownJewel) 
WHERE (crownJewel:computer OR crownJewel:domain OR crownJewel:gpo OR crownJewel:group OR crownJewel:ou OR crownJewel:user) AND crownJewel.highValue
MATCH path=shortestPath((u)-[*..100]->(crownJewel))
RETURN path;
// Question: How a user can reach an high value group? Query is:
MATCH (u:user)
MATCH (crownJewel:group)
WHERE crownJewel.highValue
MATCH path=shortestPath((u)-[*..100]->(crownJewel))
RETURN path;
// Question: What is the possible extent of this analysis? We can check similar possible attack paths in whole network. Query is:
MATCH (crownJewel:group)
MATCH (source) 
WHERE (crownJewel:computer OR crownJewel:domain OR crownJewel:gpo OR crownJewel:group OR crownJewel:ou OR crownJewel:user) AND NOT crownJewel.highValue
MATCH path = shortestPath((source)-[*..100]->(crownJewel))
WHERE source <> crownJewel
UNWIND apoc.coll.pairsMin(nodes(path)) AS pair
WITH pair[0] AS a, pair[1] AS b
RETURN a.name, 'to', b.name
